## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Because this project uses modern JavaScript Modules (`import`/`export`), you cannot run it by simply opening the `index.html` file. You must use a local development server.

The easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

1.  **Open the project folder** in VS Code.
2.  **Install the "Live Server"** extension from the Extensions marketplace.
3.  **Right-click `index.html`** in the file explorer and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

This will open the project in your browser, and everything will work correctly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas API for all real-time animations.
*   **Core Features:** Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities via a Service Worker and Web Manifest for offline support and installability.
*   **No Frameworks:** Built with pure JavaScript for maximum performance and minimal overhead.

##  Roadmap & Future Improvements

- [ ] Add a "Favorites" system to quickly save and access preferred themes.
- [ ] Implement theme-specific settings (e.g., change particle count, color palettes).
- [ ] Create a "Playlist" mode to automatically cycle through selected animations.
